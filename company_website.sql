Moreover, you will have full control over in-house agents and their actions. On the downside, building and training a professional help desk team takes time. You&rsquo;ll need to find experienced agents, onboard them, and ensure their regular training.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>Outsourcing tier 1 help desk</strong></em> eliminates the need to recruit, onboard, and train help desk agents.
