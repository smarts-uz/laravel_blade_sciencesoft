        <p class="">While some ecommerce design standards are uniform (see this <a href="#"
                                                                                   class="underline hover:text-blue-700">demo</a>
            as an example), each product line has
            its specifics, so businesses are expected to tailor digital customer experience differently. Here, we take a

        COMPETITORS</h1>

    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class=""><b> Convenient mobile viewing and shopping experience.</b> Commonly crucial across all product
            lines, mobile
            experience assumes added importance in grocery. Consumers expect all the usual convenience when placing
            online orders on the go, so a web store interface should be optimized for mobile not to perplex viewers with
            messy pages. Additionally, you may offer a voice user interface to make grocery replenishment friendly for
            your busiest customers.</p>

        <p class="mt-6"><b> Only relevant product recommendations. </b>Upselling is a sure technique to increase the
            order value. And the key
            to its success is subtlety not to deter customers by uncovered profit-centricity. Your intention behind the
            upselling must be to give a clue to shoppers as to what other products from your assortment they personally
            might need or have forgotten. Grocery orders are typically frequent, so manual analysis of each customer’s
            preferences is out of the question, as is sticking to a generalized impersonalized approach for product
            recommendations. We advocate artificial intelligence to put all the customer data to use and deliver a
            relevant and tailored attitude, with no manual involvement from your side.</p>

        <p class="mt-6"><b> Supply and demand balance. </b>Regular stockouts lead to customer frustration, while
            overstocks result in
            inventory imbalance and profit loss due to selling excess perishable products below the market. To keep the
            supply and demand aligned and tame seasonal and promotional fluctuations, you need to focus your data
            analytics solution on predictive modeling techniques. With that, you automate the process of sales data
            harvesting and base procurement and manufacturing decisions on drawn insights</p>
