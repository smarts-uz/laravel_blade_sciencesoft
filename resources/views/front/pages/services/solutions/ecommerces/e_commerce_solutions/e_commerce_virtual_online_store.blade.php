            Having a mature ecommerce store, you may end up running numerous software solutions to manage your business
            and
            several channels to sell. But the more data sources and data management systems you have, the more
            complicated
            it becomes to bring all the data under control and gain valuable insights from it.

        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            To avoid such a risk, you need a unified, cohesively functioning ecommerce ecosystem for automating data
            flows
            across systems and creating consistent customer experience in an omnichannel environment. Technically, this
            is
            achieved via ecommerce integration.

            What is ecommerce integration?
        </b>

        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            In brief, ecommerce integration means linking an ecommerce website to various sales channels and data
            management systems – accounting, inventory management, CRM, etc. Software is usually connected by means of
            application programming interface (API integration), which results in the seamless sharing of data between
            integrated systems.

            The root of all problems inherent to disconnected business systems is the lack of multidirectional data

        <p class="text-xl mt-4">
            Ecommerce website integration enables you to make data-driven decisions on customer experience and
            marketing. You get the opportunity to accumulate information about customers, their shopping preferences,
            the popularity of your products, and other important metrics in one place. With this knowledge, you can
            adapt to the patterns in customer behavior and guide their buying journeys accordingly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            For example, a marketing automation system integrated into your ecommerce business allows you to segment
            customers according to chosen criteria for better targeting, set up automated campaigns that start and
            unfold with no manual involvement, analyze the results, and get to know your customers’ needs better with
            each iteration. Also, it can draw products from your ecommerce catalog and make up tailored offerings for
            individuals. This way, you will only need to set rules or algorithms for marketing activities, and the
            system will connect to your ecommerce back end and CRM for customer and product data.

            Don’t compromise on the integration quality
        </strong>
        <p class="text-xl mt-4">
            Though ecommerce website integration offers multiple advantages, it calls for sufficient experience to
            execute it skillfully. One needs to review the systems intended for integration, investigate current
            business processes, and decide how to streamline them with automation in the best possible way. If you are
