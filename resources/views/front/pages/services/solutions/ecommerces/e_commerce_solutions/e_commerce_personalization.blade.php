            trends in the ecommerce industry and plays a huge role in achieving great customer experience. If you are

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-6 md:text-xl">
            Studies show that <a href="#" class="border-b border-indigo-900">
            80% of buyers</a> are more likely to buy from a company that has a personalized website and
            delivers personalized communication, and <a href="#" class="border-b border-indigo-900">
            tend to avoid generic messages</a> that don’t resonate with their

            In this article, I will explain the essence of ecommerce personalization, share which elements of customer
            interaction in a web store can be tailored and illustrate the ideas of personalized shopping experience with
            website examples.

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 md:text-4xl mt-6">
            What is online personalization?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            First of all, ecommerce personalization is not an obtrusive technique when you annoy customers with endless
            attempts to initiate a dialogue or sell stuff. It’s rather smart targeting when you first collect customer
            data and draw conclusions upon customers’ interests and needs, and then create logical recommendations. The
            ultimate goal of the approach is to achieve a longer dwell time and increase conversions from your website.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            Companies that are interested in creating personalized shopping experiences should be technically mature and
            have personalization software integrated with their web store to capture data about the behavior of users,
            their history of interactions with the web store, and the context of these interactions. Such data may
            include:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Geolocation.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Type of device.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Time zone.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Items abandoned in shopping carts.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Recently viewed products.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Wish list.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Past purchases.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Frequency of visiting the web store.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Purchasing frequency.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Average order volume.</li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Social media interactions with the company.</li>
        </ul>

            Home page
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            It is important for a brand to create an environment where visitors will feel heard and appreciated. Online
            shopping starts on the homepage of your website. That is the perfect moment to collect data about users and
            offer tailored experience every time they come back. This process should be transparent, and your visitors
            should decide if they want to allow you to use their data (location, gender, age, etc.).
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            By offering personalized product recommendations, you help customers find the best match and increase a
            chance of conversion – a double win for both parties! When a customer is surfing the website, the
            personalization engine analyzes their previous buying choices and offers similar items. I must say, fashion
            brands have mastered this personalization type perfectly.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            For well-executed email personalization, the two most important things are timing and friendly tone. No one
            likes spammers, but friendly reminders about a new release of a favorite product, or an abandoned cart are
            welcome. A good email strategy based on the accumulated customer knowledge can spark interest in your brand,
            and exclusive tips and offers can trigger a prospect to return to your web store and make a purchase.
            Tailored emails can create stronger connections between you and your audience. Make sure to include in
            emails personalized product recommendations described earlier, but also don’t forget to greet your customers
            by name, just like Sephora does.

            On social media platforms, you can create stories that speak to your audience directly. The benefits of
            using these channels are cost-effectiveness and a wide range of options that you can play with. In
            Instagram, you can use polls to ask your audience about important topics and collect relevant data. People
            love being involved, so this will give you active audience engagement as well as data for future content
            planning.
