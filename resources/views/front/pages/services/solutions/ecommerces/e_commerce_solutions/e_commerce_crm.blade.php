        CRM such a powerful solution for your business and shares things you need to consider before its implementation.
        And if you’re looking for the ways to win more customers, increase customer retention, and build brand loyalty,

        Having <a href="#" class="border-b border-indigo-900 hover:text-blue-700">16% </a>
        of total sales, US ecommerce shows a stable trend of growing 3-4% each year. With such increasing popularity,
        the competition in the ecommerce market becomes stiffer. To end up winning this competition, your ecommerce
        business should definitely have a 360-degree view of customers, effective customer service and personalized
        marketing campaigns to build customer loyalty – all of this is achievable with an ecommerce CRM. Tapping into my
        experience with CRM projects, let’s dive into how exactly CRM makes all of that possible for ecommerce.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 my-4 md:text-4xl">
        Ecommerce CRM basics and business benefits
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-6 md:text-xl">
        Many TeamPRO’s customers from the ecommerce industry perceive CRM as catering to the needs of salespeople,
        thus, not so effective in their domain. The truth is, at its core, ecommerce customer relationship management
        goes deeper into personalized marketing and customer service to bolster the conversion rate of your customer
        journeys. Such personalization may include individual promotions, discounts, priority customer service, just to
        name a few examples. A good example of such personalization making an impact on your customer relationships can
        be found in a project TeamPRO did for a
        <a href="#" class="border-b border-indigo-900 hover:text-blue-700">group of companies engaged in fashion retail
            and hospitality </a>
        where we implemented Dynamics 365 Marketing to enable the customer to run personalized email campaigns and
        improve their social media engagement in both their brick-and-mortar and ecommerce domains.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-6 md:text-xl">Now, when we’re done with the trivia, let’s look at what
        <span class="font-bold text-current">benefits</span> your ecommerce company can get with CRM. For example,
        according to Salesforce, a leading CRM provider, their customers achieve a 30-50% increase in the customer
        retention rate, agent productivity, and case resolution speed. And to top it off, they gain a 25-30% increase in
        their marketing ROI and purchase volume!

        Must-have ecommerce CRM features
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Now, let’s review the features your CRM should have for you to achieve considerable business improvements
        ranging from better conversion rates to increased customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        360-degree customer view
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        CRM stores your customers’ data, ranging from their actions on your website, social media mentions, purchases,
        and email openings to help requests. This data allows you to gain a deeper understanding of your customer base,
        see ways to improve your product/service quality, provide your customers with personalized offers and discounts
        as well as tiered customer service.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Customer journeys
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        You can create customer journeys mapping your
        customers’ route from the point of being a prospect to the point of becoming a brand advocate. Also, you can
        manage and adjust your interactions with your customers across various steps of their journey.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Personalized email marketing
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        CRM software allows you to perform mass email campaigns, retaining the necessary level of personalization. Your
        CRM uses customer data, such as names, deal details, etc. in email templates keeping communication personal,
        quick, and always on the topic.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Data analytics
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Based on the data collected within CRM, you can identify your best customer acquisition channels, marketing
        campaign effectiveness, popular products/services, and who are the customers most actively buying with your
        business. Such analytics may help you adjust your marketing strategy and laser-focus on profitable customer
        groups.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Marketing and customer service workflow automation
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        CRM offers automation capabilities, ranging from customer data entry to communication. For example, with email
        automation, you can set up triggers for automated messaging. And if a customer leaves your online store without
        finalizing a purchase, an email with a reminder will be sent automatically.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Knowledge and case management
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        The case management feature provides your support agents with a convenient one-window multi-tab workspace where
        all the necessary customer data and working tools are gathered. With the help of the knowledge management
        feature, your support agents can promptly share the product/service-related information with your customers
        using quick replies or smart article search.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Chatbots
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        A chatbot can become a comfortable tool for your customers to resolve simple queries (e.g., checking delivery
        status), while simultaneously decreasing your customer service costs up to 30%. The chatbot uses CRM customer
        data (name, area, etc.) to provide a personalized experience and may transfer the chat to real agents if the
        query can’t be resolved automatically.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Customer satisfaction tracking
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Employing various customer satisfaction forms, you can gain insight into where your brand stands with your
        customers and what can be done to improve their experience.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Technical aspects of ecommerce CRM implementation
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        When opting for ecommerce CRM, you have 2 options: a platform-based solution or a custom solution. If your team
        fits into licensing requirements perfectly and the proposed functionality covers your needs entirely or can be
        customized to do so — building your CRM solution on such platforms as Dynamics 365 or Salesforce, could be just
        for you. On the other hand, if you run a highly unique sales process, the concepts of which aren’t presented in
        platform-based solutions or the number of your CRM users makes buying licenses not cost-efficient, you may
        consider custom CRM development.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Regardless of the implementation option you choose, you should make sure your CRM covers the following technical
        aspects:
    </p>

    <div class="px-16">
        <ul style="list-style: disc" class="list-inside ">
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">Your CRM should be integrated with your
                ecommerce platform and website to accumulate needed customer-related data.
            </li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">CRM should be integrated with all of your
                communication channels. Having all your customer interactions recorded, be it email messaging, phone
                calls, social media interactions, or a message on a community forum, provides you with endless marketing
                opportunities, from personalized emails to custom landing pages.
            </li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">Your CRM system should be able to recognize
                duplicate records to avoid inaccurate data. Your customers may use various communication channels and
                different devices to access your store, often creating another account. Thus, having your CRM able to
                recognize each customer allows you to create an accurate picture of your customer base.
            </li>
            <li class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">As your CRM needs to store and process an
                extensive amount of data about customer interactions, you should ensure its stable performance via
                thought-out software architecture in case of custom solution development or configure your
                platform-based CRM properly.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-12 lg:text-3xl">
        Choose CRM with ROI in mind
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 my-6 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Both platform-based and custom ecommerce CRM will be able to benefit your business if you base your choice not
        solely on implementation costs but on the overall feasibility. Thus, you can maximize your custom CRM’s ROI by
        going for iterative development. In this case, you start with basic CRM functionality and get positive outcomes
        early and gradually add new features when the need arises. As for ROI of platform-based CRM, my practice shows
        that companies choosing market-leading software such as
        <a href="#" class="border-b border-indigo-900 hover:text-blue-700"> Dynamics 365 Customer Service</a>
        may see full payback in 3-6 months after implementation, reaching a total ROI of 300% largely due to automation
        capabilities. So, if you’ve decided to give ecommerce CRM a try but you’re not sure which option will perform
        best for your business,

        and implement the best feasible variant.
