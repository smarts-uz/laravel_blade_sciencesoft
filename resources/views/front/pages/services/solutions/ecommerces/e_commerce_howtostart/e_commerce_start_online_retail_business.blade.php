            In 2019, worldwide ecommerce sales reached $3.53 trillion, and revenues are expected to grow even
            further, up to $6.53 trillion by 2022. Powering this growth is an expanding army of online consumers. In
            the US alone, about 227 million people shop online on a regular basis (representing around 70% of the
            population), and the tendency is upward.

            Thus, starting an online retail business promises a good profit if you are ready to do it right to gain a
            toehold and prosper. Building on the experience of our team in all-around ecommerce services, I will walk

            1. Find your market niche
        </b>

        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            Success in online retail largely depends on whether you can find a sufficient target audience for your
            products or services. That’s a strategic question that must be settled before taking any steps towards the
            business opening. I can think of several ways to understand whether there is consumer demand within your
            planned market:

            2. Organize manufacturing and supply chain
        </b>

        <p class="text-xl mt-6">
            Once you have decided on the market niche, you can start planning a supply side of your business. If you
            have products manufactured in-house, you need to set up the procurement of raw materials, secure production
            facilities, and organize storage and transportation for end products. If you resell or distribute products
            from multiple manufacturers or wholesalers, take time to research potential vendors and negotiate win-win
            purchasing and shipment terms. </p>

    <div class="mt-6">
        <b class="text-3xl">
            3. Create a business plan
        </b>

        <p class="text-xl mt-6">
            Whether you are planning a small online retail business or have grand ambitions, coming up with a thorough
            business plan is the first never-to-miss step. Its purpose is to have all short- and long-term goals set and
            ways to achieve them elaborated and framed into actionable steps and techniques. </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            When working out a launch strategy, make the most of the resources you have now or plan to acquire.
            Resources include financial capital, human resources, raw materials, digital real estate (websites, social
            media profiles), and everything else that can be put to work to generate profit. In fact, launching a
            business successfully requires finding ways to connect the available resources to the specified goals.</p>
