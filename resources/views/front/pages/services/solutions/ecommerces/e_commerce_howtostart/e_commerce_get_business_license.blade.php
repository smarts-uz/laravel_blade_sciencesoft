        <p class="">Ecommerce is the evolution of retail, and its rapid expansion won’t stop in the near future. As of
            the second quarter of 2020, the share of online sales in the US retail amounted for 16.1%, representing an
            increase by 5.3% from the corresponding period last year. Steady industry growth sounds like a good reason
            to consider joining the ecommerce market.</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">Why to start with an online business license</h1>
    </div>


    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">Whether you are planning an e-business or a traditional brick-and-mortar store, you need a business
            license. This way, the government is enabled to control the operation of your business and tax payment.</p>
        <p>Depending on the location, the requirements for business licensing differ. In some states, you may not even
            need a business license for an online store until your sales reach a certain threshold. In other states, you
            need to obtain a license before you start selling products. Apart from the state of business operation, the
            main factors determining the licensing requirements include legal structure of your business and a product
            line. Some products require a federal business license to be sold online – this applies for instance to
            alcohol and tobacco since the government keeps track of the sales of these products.</p>

        <p>The best way to do the federal licensing right is to study the knowledge directory of SBA (U.S. Small
            Business Administration) and hire a professional counselor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">Types of licenses for ecommerce business</h1>
    </div>


    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">In most cases, in addition to a general license for online business, you will also need a <b> local
            license</b> issued by your state or city. To find out what you need to do to apply, visit the website of
            your
            local government (can be found from the <a href="#" class="underline hover:text-blue-700">directory of the
                USAGov</a>). In case you offer professional services
            (e.g., accountancy or marketing), a <b> professional license</b> is required. And if you are hiring a team,
            you will
            need an <b> employment license</b> issued by a correspondent department.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">One more document you need to sell online is a seller’s permit that puts the state in control of
            your collecting and reporting sales taxes. If you work with manufacturers or wholesalers, you need to obtain
            a resale certificate to inform the state that you buy products for resale purposes and the sale is not
            taxable.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Fees for business licenses vary from around $50 to several hundred dollars.</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">Examples of online business license requirements around the United States</h1>
    </div>


    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">In California, all businesses have to register, including those operating online. To obtain a
            general online business license, you must create a business plan, choose a company’s name, and provide the
            authorities with contact information, address, the number of employees, and a federal tax ID number. You
            will also need to decide on a business type, and be sure to choose wisely as this will define the amount of
            taxes to be paid. The registration process costs $20-150 depending on a business type. If you work from
            home, you may also be subject to certain inspections. The authorities will need to make sure you can operate
            from home or set some rules regarding the number of visitors or physical changes to the building
            allowed.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Dealing with omnichannel order fulfillment, you need an order management system where orders
            from your ecommerce channel are centralized. In the system, self-pickup orders are transferred automatically
            to order fulfillment centers at your brick-and-mortar stores and are further processed there.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">In Florida, you need a Business Tax Receipt and a Certificate of Use (except for self-employed
            and a few
            other situations). Working from home in Florida requires taking extra steps such as providing the government
            with the plan of home parts used for business purposes, submitting a notarized letter of approval from the
            property owner or property manager, and paying an additional one-time fee of $50.</p>
