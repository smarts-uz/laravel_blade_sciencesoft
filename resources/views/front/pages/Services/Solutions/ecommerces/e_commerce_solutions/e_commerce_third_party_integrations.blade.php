        <p class=" "><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In this article, we describe how integrated data flows from
            ecommerce and POS systems can help
            your online and physical stores work in sync. Read on to know the benefits of such integration and engage
            our <a href="" class="hover:text-blue-700 underline">ecommerce developers</a> to achieve them.</p>

    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">If you sell successfully via online and brick-and-mortar stores, there is a way you can make your
            business even more profitable. That is by integrating your business operations conducted via point of sale
            systems at brick-and-mortar stores and an ecommerce store to offer omnichannel consistency as a result.

    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">At Smart Software, we have experience of integrating online and offline sales channels (check <a
                href="#" class="underline hover:text-blue-700">this
            project </a> as an example), so we see direct business benefits of integration. Surely, the initiative
            requires
            investment, but here is where the ROI will come from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">No manual routine</h1>
    </div>


    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">Manual data transfer is always time-consuming and prone to human errors and inaccuracies.
            Integrating both POS and ecommerce with an inventory management system, you enable orders from your website
            and offline channels to aggregate in a single centralized system. The control over inventory levels and
            timely procurement becomes more effective and requires less effort from your team.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">You can further advance the automation of inventory management. For example, you can set minimum
            stock level
            values for SKUs and trigger an automated creation of purchase orders to suppliers. Such an option makes
            restocking less effort-consuming and helps retailers keep track of their inventory to avoid an out-of-stock
            situation. Similarly, you can detect the overstocks.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="mt-6">
        <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl">Data-driven promotions</h1>
    </div>


    <div class=" mt-8 text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        <p class="">In addition to easier restocking, knowing inventory levels helps retailers track which products are
            hot and which ones might need a promotion to fuel customers’ interest. With integrated sales data from
            ecommerce and POS, you can plan and launch special offers to sell the stale stock.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">The integration also allows your promotions to be cross-channel as you can offer loyalty
            programs, bonus
            cards, promo codes and discounts that will be active for both your online and brick-and-mortar stores. And
            surely, consumers prefer consistent experience across all their interactions with a particular brand.</p>

        <p class="">Though fast shipping has a significant impact on customer satisfaction, many buyers want to get
            their purchases even faster with the help of a self-pickup option. It adds comfort to those who prefer
            placing orders online and picking them up at brick-and-mortar stores located conveniently on their routes.
            For any retail business, this also means reduced costs related to order delivery.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Dealing with omnichannel order fulfillment, you need an order management system where orders
            from your ecommerce channel are centralized. In the system, self-pickup orders are transferred automatically
            to order fulfillment centers at your brick-and-mortar stores and are further processed there.</p>
